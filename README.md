Hey this is a new repository where I'm moving my files because of git/heroku problems so this is made purely to deploy it. 

Access Ed

The economics of poverty and or wealth of a nation is directly dependent on those who live in it and the capital they contribute to their economy. 
What the studies and data taken from the World Bank show is that education is the driving force of these nations most importantly access to it. 
Through this I was able to see what the data on education shows for developing nations, they weren't good.

The common theme amongst these nations were the lack of access to education for young girls. 
Not every country has a law against educating young girls but in many places it is the cultural norm to stop educating girls after primary school.

This application is dedicated to tracking country by country what the statistics show on girls education and is a call to action 
for those who want to do something about changing this in our lifetime.

Also if the user visiting the website is interested, they can find out what to do about it by connecting 
to an organization dedicated to helping girls access education, especially in developing nations.
The User is able to click on each marker placed on a country with a statistic of girls out of Primary School.
Below there are four organizations which the user can click on to find out more information on which will appear on a modal.
If the description makes them curious they can click on the link and be directed to their website.
